Let's say you have an application that allows you to log in using a username and password. If a user enters the username `wiener` and the password `bluecheese`, the application sends the following SQL query to check if the data is correct:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'
```
If the query returns details for this user, the user is logged in.
An attacker can log in as any user without using a password by using `--` to remove the password from the SQL query.
For example, an attacker can enter `administrator--` instead of the administrator username `administrator`, then the SQL query will be:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''
```
As a result, the attacker will log in as the administrator.
