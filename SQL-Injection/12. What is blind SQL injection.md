A Blind SQL injection occurs when an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, but its HTTP responses do not contain the results of the underlying SQL query or details of any database errors. Many techniques, such as UNION attacks, are ineffective against Blind SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is because these techniques depend on being able to see the results of the injected query in the application's responses. However, Blind SQL injection can be used to access unauthorized data, but other techniques must be used to do so.
