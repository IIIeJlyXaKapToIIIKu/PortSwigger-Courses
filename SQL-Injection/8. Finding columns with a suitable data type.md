A SQL injection attack using the `UNION` operator allows us to extract results from an injected query. The data of interest that we want to extract is usually in string format. This means that we need to find one or more columns in the original query results whose data type is string or compatible with string data.

Once we have determined the number of columns needed, we can test each column to see if it can contain string data. This can be done by sending a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads that place a string value into each column in turn. For example, if the query returns four columns, you can send:
```SQL
' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--
```
If the column's data type is not compatible with string data, the injected query will raise a database error, such as:
```ERROR
Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'a' to data type int.
```
If no error occurs and the application response has additional content, including the injected string value, then the column is suitable for retrieving string data.
