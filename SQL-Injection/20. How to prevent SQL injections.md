We can prevent most cases of SQL injection by using parameterized queries instead of concatenating strings within the query. These parameterized queries are also known as "prepared statements".
The following code is vulnerable to SQL injection because the user input is directly concatenated with the query string:
```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '"+ input + "'";
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);
```
We can rewrite this code so that the user input does not affect the structure of the query:
```java
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ?");
statement.setString(1, input);
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
```
