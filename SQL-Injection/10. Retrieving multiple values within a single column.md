In some cases, the query from the [[Using a SQL injection attack with UNION to extract interesting data|previous example]] may return only one column.
We can extract multiple values ​​in that single column by concatenating them. To do this, we can use a delimiter to help distinguish the concatenated values. For example, in Oracle, we can send the following input:
```SQL
' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--
```
This uses the string concatenation operator `||`, which in Oracle concatenates values. The injected query concatenates the values ​​of the `username` and `password` fields, separated by the `~` character.
The query results contain all usernames and passwords, for example:
```
...
administrator~s3cure
wiener~peter
carlos~montoya
...
```
