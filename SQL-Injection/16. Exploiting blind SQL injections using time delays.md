If the application handles database errors when executing a SQL query and silently fixes them, there will be no difference in the application's response. This means that the previous technique based on provoking errors will not work.
In such a situation, we can usually exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability by causing a delay in execution depending on whether the condition we injected is true or false. Since SQL queries are usually processed sequentially by the application, delaying the execution of the SQL query also delays the HTTP response. This allows us to determine the truth of the injected condition based on the time it takes to get the response.

Techniques for causing a delay depend on the type of database used. For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, we can use the following technique to check the condition and cause a delay depending on whether the expression is true or false:
```SQL
'; IF (1=2) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--
```
```SQL
'; IF (1=1) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--
```
In the first case, the delay is not triggered because the condition `1=2` is false. In the second case, the delay is 10 seconds because the condition `1=1` is true.

Using this technique, we can extract data by checking one character at a time:
```SQL
'; IF (SELECT COUNT(Username) FROM Users WHERE Username = 'administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') = 1 WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:{delay}'--
```

>**Note**  
>There are many ways to introduce a time delay within SQL queries, and different approaches apply to different types of databases.
