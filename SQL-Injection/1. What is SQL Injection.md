**SQL injection (SQLi)** is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database. This can allow the attacker to view data that they would not normally be able to access. This could be data belonging to other users or any other data that the application can access. In many cases, the attacker can modify or delete this data, causing permanent changes to the application's content or behavior. In some situations, an attacker can escalate a SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other internal infrastructure. This could also allow them to perform denial of service attacks.
