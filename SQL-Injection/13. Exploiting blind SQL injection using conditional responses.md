Suppose you have an application that uses tracking cookies to collect usage analytics. Requests to the application include a cookie header like this:
```
Cookie: TrackingId=u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4
```
When a request with such a cookie is processed, the application executes a SQL query to determine if this is a known user:
```SQL
SELECT TrackingId FROM TrackedUsers WHERE TrackingId = 'u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4'
```
This query is vulnerable to SQL injection, but the query results are not returned to the user. However, the application behaves differently depending on whether the query returns data. If you send a recognized `TrackingId`, the query will return data, and you will receive a `"Welcome back"` message in the response.
This behavior is sufficient to exploit the Blind SQL injection vulnerability. We can extract information by causing different responses depending on the injected condition.

To understand how this exploit works, imagine sending two requests containing the following `TrackingId` cookie values ​​in turn:
```
…xyz' AND '1'='1
…xyz' AND '1'='2
```
The first value causes the query to return no results because the injected condition `AND '1'='1` is true. This results in the `"Welcome back"` message being displayed.
The second value causes the query to return no results because the injected condition `AND '1'='2` is false. The `"Welcome back"` message is not displayed.
This allows us to determine the outcome of any injected condition and extract the data piecemeal.

For example, suppose there is a `Users` table with `Username` and `Password` columns, and that there is a user named `Administrator`. We can determine the password of this user by issuing a series of queries to check the password one character at a time.
To do this, start with the following input:
```SQL
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 'm
```
This query returns the message `"Welcome back"`, indicating that the injected condition is true and the first character of the password is greater than `m`. Then we send the following query:
```SQL
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 't
```
This query does not return a `"Welcome back"` message, which means that the injected condition is false and the first character of the password is not greater than `t`.
Finally, we send the following query, which returns a `"Welcome back"` message, confirming that the first character of the password is `s`:
```SQL
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 's
```
We can thus continue this process to systematically determine the full password for the `Administrator` user.
