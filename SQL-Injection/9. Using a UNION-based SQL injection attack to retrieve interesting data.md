Once we have determined the number of columns returned by the original query and know which columns may contain string data, we can begin to extract interesting data.
Let's assume that:
- The original query returns two columns, both of which may contain string data.
- The injection point is a row in the `WHERE` clause.
- The database has a table called `users` with columns `username` and `password`.

In this example, we can extract the contents of the `users` table by sending the following input:
```SQL
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
```
To perform this attack, we need to know that there is a table called `users` with two columns `username` and `password`. Without this information, we would have to guess the names of the tables and columns. All modern databases provide ways to examine the structure of the database and determine what tables and columns it contains.
