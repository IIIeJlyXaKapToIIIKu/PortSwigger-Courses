## Task
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. We can use the `UNION` attack to extract the results from the injected query.
## Solution
Go to the website

Select any category, intercept the query in `Burp Suite` and send it to `repeater`.

Write a SQL injection to find how many columns there are in total. We see that the page has loaded successfully and displayed the two rows specified in the query.
```SQL
'+UNION+SELECT+'ABC','DEF'#
```

Now we replace any value with `@@version` and see the database version on the page
