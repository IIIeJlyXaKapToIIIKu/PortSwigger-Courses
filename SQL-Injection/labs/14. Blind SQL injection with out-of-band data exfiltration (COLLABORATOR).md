## Task
This lab has a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses tracking cookies for analytics and executes a SQL query containing the value of the sent cookie.
The SQL query is executed asynchronously and does not affect the application's response. However, we can initiate an out-of-band interaction with an external domain.
There is another table in the database called `users` with columns `username` and `password`. We need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the user `administrator`.
To solve the task, you need to log in as an administrator.
>[!info] Note
To prevent the Academy platform from being used to attack third-party resources, our firewall blocks communication between labs and any external systems. To solve the problem, you need to use the default public Burp Collaborator server.
## Solution
Go to the website page
![[Pasted image 20241222205408.png]]
Refresh the page, intercept the request via `Burp Suite` and send it to `Repeater`
![[Pasted image 20241222205446.png]]
Generate `payload` and insert it into `TrackerId`
![[Pasted image 20241222205531.png]]
Instead of `BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN`, insert `payload` from `Collaborator`
![[Pasted image 20241222205920.png]]
Send the request and go to the `Collaborator` tab. In it, click the button `Poll now`
![[Pasted image 20241222205958.png]]And here is the password from `administrator`
