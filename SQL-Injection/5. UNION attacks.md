If your application is vulnerable to SQL injection and the results of a query are returned in application responses, you can use the `UNION` keyword to retrieve data from other tables in the database. This is commonly known as a `UNION` SQL injection attack.
The `UNION` keyword allows you to execute one or more additional `SELECT` queries and append their results to the original query. For example:
```SQL
SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2
```
This SQL query returns a single result set with two columns containing values ​​from columns `a` and `b` in `table1` and columns `c` and `d` in `table2`.

For a query with `UNION` to work, the following must be true:
- The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
- The data types of each column must be compatible between separate queries
To perform a `UNION` SQL injection attack, make sure your attack meets these two requirements. Typically, this involves finding out:
- How many columns are returned from the original query.
- Which columns returned from the original query have the appropriate data type to hold the results of the injected query.
