In the previous labs, we used a query string to inject a malicious SQL payload. However, SQL injection attacks can be performed using any manipulated input that is processed as a SQL query by the application. For example, some websites accept data in JSON or XML format and use it to query a database. These different formats can provide different ways to disguise attacks that are otherwise blocked by **WAF** and other defense mechanisms. Weak implementations often look for common SQL injection keywords in the query, so you can bypass these filters by encoding or escaping characters in disallowed keywords. For example, the following XML-based SQL injection uses the XML escape sequence to encode the S character in `SELECT`:
```SQL
<stockCheck>
    <productId>123</productId>
    <storeId>999 &#x53;ELECT * FROM information_schema.tables</storeId>
</stockCheck>
```
This will be decoded on the server side before being passed to the SQL interpreter.
