On Oracle, each `SELECT` query must use the `FROM` keyword and specify a valid table. Oracle has a built-in table named `dual` that can be used for this purpose. Therefore, injected queries on Oracle would look like this:
```SQL
' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--
```
The described payloads use a comment using a sequence of double hyphens `--` to comment out the remainder of the original query after the injection point. On MySQL, a space must follow the sequence of double hyphens. You can also use the hash character `#` to indicate a comment.
