You can detect SQL injection manually by using a systematic set of tests for each entry point into the application. This typically involves sending:
- The single quote character `'` and looking for errors or other anomalies.
- Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point and to another value, and looking for systematic differences in the application's responses.
- Boolean conditions such as `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2`, and looking for differences in the application's responses.
- A payload designed to trigger time delays when executing the SQL query, and looking for differences in the time it takes to respond.
- An `OAST` payload designed to trigger out-of-band network communication when executing the SQL query, and monitoring all communications that occur.
Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur in the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query. Most experienced testers are familiar with this type of SQL injection.
However, SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur anywhere in a query and in different types of queries. Other common places for SQL injections to occur are:
- In `UPDATE` statements - in the updated values ​​or in the `WHERE` clause.
- In `INSERT` statements - within the inserted values.
- In `SELECT` statements - in the table or column name.
- In `SELECT` statements - in the `ORDER BY` clause.
