## How do file upload vulnerabilities occur?
Given the fairly obvious dangers, it's rare to see sites *in the wild* that don't restrict the types of files that can be uploaded at all. More often, developers implement what they think is a robust check, but it's either inherently flawed or easily bypassed.

For example, they might try to create a blacklist of dangerous file types, but fail to account for differences in `parsing discrepancies` when checking extensions. As with any blacklist, it's easy to accidentally miss less common but still dangerous file types.

In other cases, a site might check a file type based on properties that are easily manipulated with tools like `Burp Proxy` or `Repeater`.

Ultimately, even robust checks may be applied inconsistently across the network of hosts and directories that make up the site, creating differences that can be exploited.
