## What are the implications of file upload vulnerabilities?
The impact of file upload vulnerabilities usually depends on two key factors:
1. What aspect of the file the website does not properly check: its size, type, contents, etc.
2. What restrictions are placed on the file after it has been successfully uploaded.

In the worst case scenario, the file type is not properly checked and the server configuration allows certain file types (such as `.php` and `.jsp`) to be executed as code. In this case, an attacker could potentially upload a server-side file with code that acts as a web shell, effectively giving them complete control over the server.

If the file name is not properly checked, this could allow an attacker to overwrite critical files simply by uploading a file with the same name. If the server is also vulnerable to `Directory Traversal`, this could mean attackers are able to upload files even to unintended locations.

Failure to ensure that file sizes meet expected thresholds can also result in a `DoS` (Denial of Service) attack, in which an attacker fills up all available disk space.
