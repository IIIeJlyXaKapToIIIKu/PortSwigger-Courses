## Exploiting File Upload Vulnerabilities Without Remote Code Execution
In the examples we've seen, we were able to upload server-side scripts for `RCE`. This is the most severe consequence, but vulnerabilities can be exploited in other ways as well.

## Uploading Malicious Client-Side Scripts
While we can't execute scripts on the server, it is possible to upload scripts for client-side attacks. For example, when uploading `HTML` files or `SVG` images, we can use `<script>` tags to create `stored XSS`.

If the file is displayed on a page that other users visit, their browser will execute the script when rendering. Due to the `same-origin` policy, this attack only works if the file is served from the same origin where it was uploaded.

## Exploiting File Handling Vulnerabilities
If the file is stored and served securely, the last option is to exploit format parsing vulnerabilities. For example, if the server processes `XML` files (`.doc`, `.xls`), this can be a vector for `XXE injection`.
