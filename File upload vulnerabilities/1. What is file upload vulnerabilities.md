## What are file upload vulnerabilities?
File upload vulnerabilities occur when a web server allows users to upload files to its `file system` without properly checking their name, type, content, or size. Failure to enforce proper restrictions means that even a basic image upload feature can be used to upload arbitrary and potentially malicious files. These could even be `server-side scripts` that allow remote code execution.

In some cases, the act of uploading a file can cause harm. Other attacks may require a subsequent `HTTP request` for that file to force the server to execute it.
