## How to Prevent File Upload Vulnerabilities
Allowing users to upload files is a common practice, and it is not necessarily dangerous if the right precautions are taken. The most effective defenses include:
1. **Extension Whitelisting**: Allow only known safe extensions instead of blocking them via a blacklist.
2. **Dangerous Substring Blocking**: Ensure that the filename does not contain sequences like `../` or characters interpreted as directories.
3. **File Renaming**: Avoid conflicts and overwriting existing files.
4. **Delayed Saving**: Do not put files into the persistent `filesystem` until all validation is complete.
5. **Use Proven Frameworks**: Use built-in upload handling mechanisms instead of custom solutions.
