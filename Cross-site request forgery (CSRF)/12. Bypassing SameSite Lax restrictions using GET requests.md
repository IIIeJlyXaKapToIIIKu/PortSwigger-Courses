In practice, servers do not always strictly distinguish whether they receive a `GET` or `POST` request to a particular `endpoint`, even if a form submission is expected. If the `SameSite Lax` session cookie restriction mode is used (either explicitly or due to the browser's default settings), we can still perform a CSRF attack by prompting the victim's browser to send a `GET` request.
As long as the request is made at the top navigation level, the browser will continue to include the victim's session `cookie`. Here is one of the simplest ways to do this:
```HTML
<script>
    document.location = 'https://vulnerable-website.com/account/transfer-payment?recipient=hacker&amount=1000000';
</script>
```

Even if a normal `GET` request is not allowed, some frameworks provide the ability to override the method specified in the query string. For example, `Symfony` supports a `_method` parameter in forms that takes precedence over the regular method when routing:
```HTML
<form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/account/transfer-payment" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="GET">
    <input type="hidden" name="recipient" value="hacker">
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000000">
</form>
```
Other frameworks also support various similar parameters.
