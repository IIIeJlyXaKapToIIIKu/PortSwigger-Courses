Manually creating the HTML code needed to exploit a CSRF vulnerability can be tedious, especially if the desired request contains a large number of parameters or has various peculiarities. The easiest way to create a CSRF exploit is to use the PoC (Proof of Concept) generator built into Burp Suite Professional:
1. Select any request in Burp Suite Professional that you want to test or use in an attack.
2. From the context menu (right-click), select **Engagement tools / Generate CSRF PoC**.
3. Burp Suite will generate HTML code that will run the selected request (except for cookies, which will be automatically added by the victim's browser).
4. If necessary, adjust various parameters in the CSRF PoC generator to account for special cases or unusual request features.
5. Copy the generated HTML to a web page, open it in a browser logged into the vulnerable site, and check if the request is sent successfully and the desired action is performed.
