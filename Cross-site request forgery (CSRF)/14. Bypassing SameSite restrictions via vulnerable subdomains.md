If we are testing someone else's site or trying to protect our own, it is important to remember that a request can still be considered `same-site` even if it is initiated from a different domain (`cross-origin`).
Let's make sure we thoroughly check the entire attack surface, including any related domains. Vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary retry requests (e.g. XSS) are especially dangerous, as they can completely bypass domain-based protection and expose all domains of the site to cross-site attacks.
In addition to classic CSRF, it is worth remembering that if the target site supports `WebSocket`, this functionality may be vulnerable to `cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH)`. This is essentially the same CSRF attack, but it targets the `WebSocket` handshake. For more details, see the section on `WebSocket` vulnerabilities.
