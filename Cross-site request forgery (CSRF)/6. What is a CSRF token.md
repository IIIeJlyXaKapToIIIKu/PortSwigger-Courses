A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server application and passed to the client. When sending a request to perform a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token. Otherwise, the server will refuse to perform the requested action. A common way to pass CSRF tokens to the client is to include them as a hidden parameter in an HTML form, like this:
```HTML
<form name="change-email-form" action="/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
    <label>Email</label>
    <input required type="email" name="email" value="example@normal-website.com">
    <input required type="hidden" name="csrf" value="50FaWgdOhi9M9wyna8taR1k3ODOR8d6u">
    <button class='button' type='submit'> Update email </button>
</form>
```

Submitting this form results in the following request:
```Request
POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
Content-Length: 70
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

csrf=50FaWgdOhi9M9wyna8taR1k3ODOR8d6u&email=example@normal-website.com
```
When implemented correctly, CSRF tokens help protect against CSRF attacks by making it more difficult for an attacker to create a valid request on behalf of the victim. Since an attacker cannot predict the correct value of a CSRF token, they will not be able to include it in a malicious request.

> **Note**  
> CSRF tokens do not necessarily have to be passed as hidden parameters in a POST request. Some applications place CSRF tokens in HTTP headers, for example. The way in which tokens are passed has a significant impact on the overall security of the mechanism. For more information, see [[How to Prevent CSRF Vulnerabilities]].
