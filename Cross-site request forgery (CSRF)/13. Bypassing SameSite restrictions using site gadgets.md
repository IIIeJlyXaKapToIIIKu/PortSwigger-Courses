If a cookie is set with the SameSite=Strict attribute, browsers will not include it in any cross-site requests. We can bypass this restriction if we can find a "gadget" that causes a repeat request within the same site.
One such gadget could be a client-side redirect, which dynamically constructs a redirect address using URL parameters or other input controlled by the attacker. Examples can be found in our materials on DOM-based open redirection.

From the browser's perspective, such client-side redirects are not actually redirects. The resulting request is treated as a normal, stand-alone request. The important thing is that the request is within the same site, so all cookies associated with the site will be included in it, regardless of the restrictions set.
If we can manipulate such a gadget to cause a malicious repeat request, this would completely bypass any SameSite cookie restrictions.

> **Note**  
> The equivalent attack is not possible with server-side redirects. In this case, the browser understands that the request following the redirect was originally a cross-site request, so all relevant cookie restrictions remain in effect.
