In addition to CSRF token defenses, some applications use the HTTP Referer header to attempt to protect against CSRF attacks, typically by verifying that the request came from the application's own domain. This approach is generally less effective and is often prone to bypass.
#### Referer Header
The HTTP Referer header (misspelled in the HTTP specification) is an optional request header that contains the URL of the web page that navigates to the requested resource. It is typically added automatically by browsers when a user initiates an HTTP request, such as by clicking on a link or submitting a form. There are various ways for the origin page to hide or change the value of the Referer header, often for privacy reasons.
