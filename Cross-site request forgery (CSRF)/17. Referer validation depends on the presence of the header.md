Some applications check the `Referer` header if it is present in requests, but skip checking if this header is not sent.
In this situation, an attacker can create a CSRF exploit so that the victim's browser does not send the `Referer` header in the resulting request. There are several ways to achieve this, but the simplest is to use a `META` tag inside the `HTML` page that hosts the CSRF attack:
```HTML
<meta name="referrer" content="never">
```
