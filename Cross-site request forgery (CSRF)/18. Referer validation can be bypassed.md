Some applications check the `Referer` header too naively, and this check can be bypassed. For example, if an application checks that the domain in the Referer starts with the expected value, an attacker can add it as a subdomain of their own domain:
```HTML
http://vulnerable-website.com.attacker-website.com/csrf-attack
```
Similarly, if an application simply checks that the `Referer` header contains the site's domain name, an attacker can put the desired value anywhere in the URL:
```HTML
http://attacker-website.com/csrf-attack?vulnerable-website.com
```

> **Note**  
> While we can detect this behavior with Burp, when testing our Proof-of-Concept in a browser, we often find that this method no longer works. To reduce the risk of leaking sensitive data, many browsers strip the query string from the Referer header by default.
> We can disable this behavior by ensuring that the response containing the exploit has a `Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url` header. (Note that there is no typo in the word **Referrer** here, just to be on the lookout!) This ensures that the full URL, including the query string, is sent in the Referer.
