The delivery mechanisms of a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack are essentially the same as those for reflected XSS. Typically, an attacker places malicious HTML on a website they control and then tricks users into visiting that website. This can be done by sending the user a link to the website via email or a social media post. Or, if the attack is placed on a popular website (e.g. in a user comment), the attacker can simply wait for users to visit that site.

> **Note**  
> Note that some simple CSRF exploits use the GET method and can be completely self-contained with a single URL on the vulnerable website. In such a situation, the attacker may not need to use an external site and can directly provide victims with a malicious link on the vulnerable domain. In the example above, if the request to change the email address could be made using the GET method, the standalone attack would look like this:

```HTML
<img src="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net">
```
