**SameSite** is a browser security mechanism that detects when a website's `cookies` are included in requests originating from other websites. `SameSite` cookie restrictions provide partial protection against a variety of cross-site attacks, including CSRF, cross-site data leaks, and some CORS exploits.

As of 2021, Chrome will enforce `Lax` level of `SameSite` restrictions by default unless the website setting the `cookie` explicitly sets its own restriction level. This is a proposed standard, and we expect other major browsers to adopt this behavior in the future. As a result, it is critical to have a good understanding of how these restrictions work, as well as how they can potentially be bypassed, in order to thoroughly test cross-site attack vectors.

In this section, we will first review how the `SameSite` mechanism works and explain some related terminology. We'll then explore some of the most common ways to bypass these restrictions, allowing CSRF and other cross-site attacks to be performed on websites that may initially appear to be safe.
