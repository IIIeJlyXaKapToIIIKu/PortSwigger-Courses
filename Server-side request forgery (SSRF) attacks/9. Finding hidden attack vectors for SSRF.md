## Finding Hidden Attack Vectors for SSRF
Many SSRF vulnerabilities are easy to spot because normal application requests contain parameters with full URLs. Other cases are harder to find.
#### Partial URLs in Requests
Sometimes an application only includes the hostname or part of the URL path in the parameters. The server side then forms the full URL for the request from this. If the value is clearly recognized as a host or path, the attack vector may be obvious. However, exploitation as a full SSRF is often limited because we do not control the entire resulting URL.
#### URLs in Data Formats
Some applications transmit data in formats that allow URL inclusion (such as XML). When the format parser automatically requests such URLs, this can lead to SSRF. A prominent example is XXE injections in XML, which can also be exploited for SSRF. We will cover this in more detail in the XXE module.
#### SSRF via Referer header
Some applications use server-side analytics software to track visitors. Often it:
1. Logs the `Referer` header to analyze incoming links
2. Automatically visits third-party URLs from this header
3. Analyzes the content of referral sites (including link text)
This makes `Referer` a common vector for SSRF attacks.
