In `Burp Suite`, intercept the request. We see that there is a request to `API`, which contains the `URL` for checking the availability of the product.

Let's try replacing this link with `http://localhost/admin`:

We send a request and see that the admin panel has appeared on the same product page.

If we hover over `Delete`, we will see a link that deletes the user `Carlos`.

We write the end of this link in the request to check the availability of the product and send the request:
```URL
http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos
```

User `Carlos` is deleted, and the lab work is completed.
