## Task
To solve the task, change the inventory check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and remove the user `carlos`.
The developer has installed two weak SSRF protections that you will need to bypass.
## Solution
We open the lab site and go to any product. We check its availability and intercept the request in `Burp Suite`, which we send to `Repeater`.

Simple `http://localhost/admin` is filtered here. Let's try another way
```URL
http://LoCaLHoSt/Admin
```

It worked. Let's check the admin panel and delete the user.

User `Carlos` is deleted and the lab is done.
