## Consequences of SSRF attacks
A successful SSRF attack often results in unauthorized actions or access to data within an organization. This can include both the vulnerable application and other internal systems that the application may interact with. In some situations, an SSRF vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.

Exploiting SSRF by causing connections to external third-party systems can lead to subsequent malicious attacks. These attacks will appear to originate from the organization whose vulnerable application hosts the vulnerability.

SSRF attacks often exploit trust relationships to escalate an attack from the vulnerable application and perform unauthorized actions. These trust relationships may exist either with the server or with other internal systems within the same organization.
