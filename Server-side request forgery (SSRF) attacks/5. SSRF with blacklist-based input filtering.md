## SSRF with blacklist-based input filtering
It is common to see applications that contain `SSRF` behavior along with protections intended to prevent malicious exploitation. Often these protections can be bypassed.

Some applications block input containing hostnames like `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, or sensitive URLs like `/admin`. In such cases, you can bypass the filter using the following methods:
1. **Alternate IP representations**:
    Use alternative forms of `127.0.0.1`, for example:
    - Decimal representation: `2130706433`
    - Octal: `017700000001`
    - Short form: `127.1`
2. **Custom domain**:
    Register a domain that resolves to `127.0.0.1` (for example, `spoofed.burpcollaborator.net`).
3. **String obfuscation**:
    Mask blocked strings via:
    - URL encoding (e.g. `%6c%6f%63%61%6c%68%6f%73%74`)
    - Case change (e.g. `LoCaLhOsT`)
4. **Controlled redirects**:
    Specify the URL of a server you control that will redirect to the target address. In this case:
    - Experiment with response codes (302, 307, etc.)
    - Change the protocol during redirection (e.g. from `http:` to `https:`), which sometimes bypasses filters.
