## SSRF attack against other backend systems
In some cases, the application server may interact with internal systems that are not directly accessible to users. Such systems often have private IP addresses that are not routable on the Internet. They are usually protected by the network topology, so their level of protection may be lower. Often, internal systems contain sensitive functionality that is accessible without authentication to anyone who can interact with them.

In the previous example, let's imagine that there is an admin interface at the internal URL `https://192.168.0.68/admin`. An attacker can send the following request to exploit SSRF and access the admin panel:
```Request
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://192.168.0.68/admin
```
