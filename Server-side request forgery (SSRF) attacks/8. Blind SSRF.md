## Blind SSRF vulnerabilities

A blind SSRF occurs when an application can be tricked into making a backend HTTP request to a given URL, but the response to that request is not returned in the application's main response.

Blind SSRF is more difficult to exploit, but sometimes it can lead to full remote code execution on the server or other internal components.

## What are the consequences of blind SSRF vulnerabilities?

The consequences of blind SSRF vulnerabilities are often less severe than classic SSRF due to their one-way nature. They cannot be directly used to extract data from internal systems, but in some cases they can lead to remote code execution.

## How to detect and exploit blind SSRF vulnerabilities

The most reliable detection method is to use out-of-band techniques (OAST). To do this, you need to try to trigger an HTTP request to an external system you are monitoring and monitor network interactions with it.

The simplest and most effective tool for OAST is Burp Collaborator. With it, you can:
1. Generate unique domain names
2. Send them as a payload to the application
3. Monitor interactions with these domains
If the application sends an HTTP request, the vulnerability is confirmed.

> [!info] Note
> When testing for SSRF, you often see a DNS request to the Collaborator domain, but no subsequent HTTP request. This usually means that the application tried to make an HTTP request (causing a DNS request), but it was blocked by a network filter. The infrastructure often allows outgoing DNS traffic, but blocks HTTP connections to unexpected addresses.

Detecting a blind SSRF that causes out-of-band requests alone does not guarantee successful exploitation. Since the backend response is unavailable, the contents of internal systems cannot be examined. However, this allows:

- Scanning the internal IP space for known vulnerabilities
- Using blind out-of-band techniques to identify critical vulnerabilities on unpatched servers

Another exploitation method:

1. Forcing the application to connect to an attacker-controlled server

2. Sending a malicious response to the application's HTTP client

If there is a serious vulnerability in the HTTP client implementation, this can lead to remote code execution in the application's infrastructure.
